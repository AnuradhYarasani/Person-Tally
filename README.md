## Methodology:
- **1.Data Collection**:Data Collection: Gather a dataset of images or videos containing scenes with people. Include various scenarios with different lighting conditions, backgrounds, and crowd densities. Annotate the dataset with bounding boxes around each person.
- **2.Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting data to increase its diversity. Augmentation techniques may include rotation, flipping, cropping, and adjusting brightness/contrast.
- **3.Object Detection**: Train an object detection model to detect people in images or video frames. Popular object detection architectures like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), or Faster R-CNN can be used. Train the model using the annotated dataset.
- **4.Person Tracking**: Implement a person tracking algorithm to track individuals across multiple frames in a video sequence. You can use techniques like Kalman filters, Hungarian algorithm, or deep learning-based trackers (e.g., DeepSORT) to associate detections from consecutive frames.
- **5.Counting Algorithm**: Develop a counting algorithm that aggregates the tracked individuals over time to calculate the total person count. Depending on the application, you may need to filter out false positives, handle occlusions, and account for people entering or leaving the scene.
- **6.Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of your person tally system using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) for object detection, as well as accuracy and error rate for counting.
- **7.Optimization**: Fine-tune your models and algorithms based on the evaluation results to improve accuracy and robustness. Experiment with hyperparameters, model architectures, and data augmentation strategies to optimize performance.
- **8.Deployment**: Deploy the person tally system in your desired application environment. This could be a standalone software application, integrated into a surveillance system, or deployed on edge devices for real-time monitoring.
- **9.Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the performance of your system in real-world scenarios and address any issues that arise. Regularly update the models and algorithms with new data to adapt to changes in the environment or user requirements.
